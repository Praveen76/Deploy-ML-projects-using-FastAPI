# Deploy-ML-projects-using-FastAPI

This repository contains the code and instructions for deploying a machine learning model using FastAPI, a modern, fast, and high-performance web framework for building APIs.

## Project overview

The project uses a pre-trained model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on their features such as age, sex, class, fare, etc. The model is packaged as a Python wheel file using `setuptools` and `wheel`. The model is then served as a RESTful API using FastAPI, which allows users to send requests and receive predictions in JSON format. The API also provides interactive documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Requests
- Pandas
- Numpy

You can install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To run the API server, execute the following command:

`uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

To test the API, you can use the interactive documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`, or use a tool like `curl` or `Postman`.

For example, you can send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "PassengerId": 1,
  "Pclass": 3,
  "Name": "Braund, Mr. Owen Harris",
  "Sex": "male",
  "Age": 22,
  "SibSp": 1,
  "Parch": 0,
  "Ticket": "A/5 21171",
  "Fare": 7.25,
  "Cabin": null,
  "Embarked": "S"
}
```

And you will receive a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "PassengerId": 1,
  "prediction": 0,
  "probability": 0.087
}
```

Where `prediction` is either 0 (did not survive) or 1 (survived), and `probability` is the corresponding probability.
